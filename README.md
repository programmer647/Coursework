# Coursework



Currently doing:



Next steps:
get uniform booklet and write code to insert default items into table


Things to ask for help about:


Random thoughts:
totals will have to be calculated as you add items to the basket so that it can be displayed
stock will be subtracted when the order is completed - allows for the possibility of removing items from the basket later
what house to put for laxton/sadler/scott because the money all goes to folss - do one generic one?
maybe change hsm name and matron name in table to their email addresses as names might not be relevant. Or just get rid of it altogether
ask what size small and large starts on uniform items
