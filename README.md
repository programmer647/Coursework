Things to ask for help about:


Random thoughts:
totals will have to be calculated as you add items to the basket so that it can be displayed
stock will be subtracted when the order is completed - allows for the possibility of removing items from the basket later

maybe change hsm name and matron name in table to their email addresses as names might not be relevant. Or just get rid of it altogether
might need to get rid of houses table
if I get rid of houses table take new screenshots of tables which depend on it and then put them into the word document - i have already edited the code but the screenshots and description of the table would need to be changed
maybe add pop up button to complete page in case someone presses it by accident
