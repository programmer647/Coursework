# Coursework




Currently doing:
ask for information about the shop to go in about us page
shop overview page
ask about which price to display - smaller or larger or both


Next steps:
subracting stock when order is completed
CSS for checkout pages
add new category for sixth form uniform
add more uniform so that shop page can be tested properly
add another category to type table with page with more information


Pages that need changing because of table change:
install
shop
barcode checkout
add to basket



Things to ask for help about:



Random thoughts:
stock will be subtracted when the order is completed - allows for the possibility of removing items from the basket later

maybe change hsm name and matron name in table to their email addresses as names might not be relevant. Or just get rid of it altogether
might need to get rid of houses table
if I get rid of houses table take new screenshots of tables which depend on it and then put them into the word document - i have already edited the code but the screenshots and description of the table would need to be changed
need to fix CSS so that when the page is made smaller it still looks ok
need to add validation where a user canâ€™t add an item to their basket unless they are logged in
maybe need to make a way where it saves your order so that you can go back to it
change it so that user's can't have more items than there are available in their baskets - do this by subtracting it from the stock as soon as it is added to the basket


need to go back to sign up page and change it so that it alerts and redirects instead of doing it on the page



(might need to add something to orders table to be able to see if an order has been completed or not)
(have edited the install file to put in the other information but need to check the lengths of things and update the writeup)
