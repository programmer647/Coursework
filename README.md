# Coursework



Currently doing:
finish sign up page so that it adds to the database - currently doing validation


Next steps:
subracting stock when order is completed
CSS for logout and checkout pages


Things to ask for help about:
manual checkout page


Random thoughts:
stock will be subtracted when the order is completed - allows for the possibility of removing items from the basket later

maybe change hsm name and matron name in table to their email addresses as names might not be relevant. Or just get rid of it altogether
might need to get rid of houses table
if I get rid of houses table take new screenshots of tables which depend on it and then put them into the word document - i have already edited the code but the screenshots and description of the table would need to be changed
maybe add pop up button to complete page in case someone presses it by accident
need to fix CSS so that when the page is made smaller it still looks ok



addtobasket page needs:
uniformid

maybe add something into addtobasket page to differentiate between manual entries and barcode entries
